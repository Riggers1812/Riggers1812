# David Rigby

## Hi there, welcome! :wave:

I'm a skilful Business Intelligence Analyst delivering a variety of analyses, insights, and reports. I’m passionate about learning new skills and using data to make a meaningful impact—whether that’s solving business problems, helping others grow, or improving the world around me.

I believe in leaving things better than I found them. That means sharing knowledge to create joy and happiness, supporting those around me, and caring for the environment—making it cleaner, tidier, and healthier through everyday actions.
