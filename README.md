# David Rigby

## Hi there :wave:

I am a skilful Business Intelligence Analyst delivering a variety of analyses, insight and reports.  I am always ready to learn new skills.  
I want to feel that the world has gained from my existence. I want to help & look after the people around me by sharing knowledge and skills through interacting with people to create joy and happiness. I want to make the environment around me cleaner and tidier to leave it healthier than before I was there, therefore, looking after the environment as a whole.
